Nothing is perfect and Mace is no exception!

Here is a list of known bugs affecting Mace 1.10 when used with Minecraft 1.2.5:

 * Various problems due to the conversion to Anvil map format. Broken double doors, single chests facing the wrong way, etc.
  * This will be fixed when an Anvil compatible version of Substrate is released. I imagine that updating Substrate to Anvil format is very complicated, so let's have patience.

 * The terrain and regions suddenly change between the city and the natural terrain
  * This is because the terrain is being generated by two separate applications. I'm hoping that future versions of Minecraft will allow for this problem to be fixed or lessened.

 * The spawn location isn't in the direction of the city.
  * I'm currently trying to figure out how to fix this. Look for a fix soon!

 * Millenaire sometimes overwrites the Mace cities with it's own cities.
  * Unfortunately this is out of my control.

 * The code may not work on OSX.
  * Please let me know about your experiences with running the code on OSX, whether they are good or bad.

 * Portal blocks are not rotated correctly 50% of the time.
  * Minecraft doesn't allow them to be rotated when they aren't part of a portal. So unfortunately nothing can be done about this.

 * Lily pads don't rotate.
  * Minecraft determines the lily pad direction by location - it can't be changed. See the [http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Lily_Pad lily pad wiki page] for details.
